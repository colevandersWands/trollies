  no more events
    physics just play out

    sameish thoughts as fabien
      more effective rhetoric
      more thorough experience

    stengths & weaknesses 
      - mine, not this paper's
      good for personal development of ideas
      and for starting discussions
      bad for making a well-defined point
      or getting on the page

technical
  neww - start with core
    global state
      levels: {name:level_state}
      user_name: 'string'
      score: num[inferred from levels?]
      game_log: [{entries}]

    level state
      tracks: {left: num, right: num}
      flips_log: [{time, state[or this is inferred?]}]
      lever_state: boolean
      time: initialize timer at top
      moral_judgement: 'string'

    game actions
      set_name
      get_score
      update_score
    level actions
      function(points) {
        this('cache').score += points;
      }
    ui components
      lever: two states, reads from lever-state
    game system
      a form a top-down rendering for direction & lever 
      event fires when critical point is reached
        by collision? coordinates? time?
        can be generalized over different screens
      stages: bananas, something else, people
        can be local html's -> window.game
        could use janke caches for levels, push to global state in between
    game play
      steps
        enter a new level
        some instructions
        timer starts (different timer per level)
        make decisions
        timer ends, final decision is read
      can be hardcoded into each level's cache
        <head>
          <script>
            var bananas = game.cache({level object});
            bananas('cache').thing
            game.gamelog = {important meta info}
            game.push_level(bananas('cache'));
        </head>
        allows levels to pick up where they left off



  oldd - start with ui
    motion
      start with default accelerating motion straight towards people
      identify coordinates of intersection
      lever can be looked at to toggle it
      have a listener// that waits for trolly to reach intersection coordinates
        or done by collision with entity? triggers event to update direction
      updates new direction based on toggled state of lever
